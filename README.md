# EmployeeDirectory

## User Story
As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

Given a list of random users generated from the Random User API, when the user loads the page, a list of employees should render.

The user should be able to:
- Sort the list by at least one category ( User can search by name, phone number, email)
- Filter the users by at least one property
